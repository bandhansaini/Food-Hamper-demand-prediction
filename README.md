# Food-Hamper-demand-prediction
The project focus on predicting the demand for food hampers, analyzing their geographical distribution, and understanding patterns, such as their relation to holidays and other variables. Here's an overview of the project's content and key activities:

Objective:
Predict the number of food hampers needed in specific geographical areas.
Analyze how demand correlates with factors like holidays (e.g., Christmas, Ramadan) and regional characteristics.
Steps Involved:
Data Cleaning:

Preparing and cleaning datasets related to food hamper pickups and client data.
Handling missing values and ensuring consistency in date formats.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features, such as family size from dependent data, and special occasion flags for holidays.
Extracting geographical data (city and state) from addresses and calculating distances from a central distribution point (e.g., Edmonton).
Time Series Analysis:

Analyzing daily, weekly, and monthly patterns in hamper pickups.
Rolling statistics and lagging demand for short- and long-term trends.
Visualization:

Creating visual representations to understand trends, such as demand by days of the week, months, and years.
Plotting geographical data to visualize demand hotspots.
Statistical Analysis and Modeling:

Correlation analysis between features to identify key drivers of demand.
Implementing regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict demand.
Holiday and Event Impact:

Measuring the impact of holidays like Christmas and Ramadan on demand.
Predicting future demand based on historical holiday data and trends.
Geographical Analysis:

Mapping demand using postal codes and geographic coordinates.
Using tools like Folium for interactive maps to visualize demand distribution.

This project involves a mix of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to provide actionable insights for managing food hamper distribution effectively.
